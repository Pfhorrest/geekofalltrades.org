I am a Conservatively Progressive Libertarian Socialist

- Socialist -- in the sense that I am concerned with the general welfare, pursuing politics for altruistic ends, looking out for all
- Libertarian -- in the sense that I oppose authority of any sort, and support self-determination for everyone
- Progressive -- in the sense that I think there is a lot of room for improvement and we need to be making changes for the better all around
- Conservative -- in the sense that I think any changes need to be made very cautiously, without breaking any of the good stuff we already have going

The purpose of government is to do two general things, both to the general purpose of providing equal opportunity for everyone:
- Protect people from each other, or keep the strong from physically abusing the weak
- Protect people from bad luck, or keep the fortunate from economically abusing the unfortunate.



But for a more concrete idea of where I stand, this would be my to-do list, in chronological order, if I could somehow direct the course of politics for as long as it took to get it all done:

WAR AND CRIME:
Abolish all victimless crimes (except tax evasion, for the time being) and end all foreign military interventions (unless someone requests our defense and we think they are the legitimate victim and we can afford to get involved without starting WWIII or something). Focus law enforcement and military on defending people from aggressors only, and otherwise leave people alone.

Cut tons of spending from maintaining a police state (DEA, TSA, INS) and a military empire (wars of aggression, occupations, overseas bases). But stay hard on violent crimes (assault, abduction, vandalism, theft, etc) and actual defense (national guard, coast guard) and maybe even ramp them up a bit where lacking with the money saved.


SOCIAL SERVICES:
- Redirect the money that was going to the various wars on abstract concepts cancelled above, and put it into subsidizing affordable education and health care for everyone, so we have a mentally and physically capable workforce, and into network infrastructure (communication, transportation, power, etc) needed to connect them all together into a productive economy.

Provide needs-based social services (food, clothing, shelter, medicine, etc) and ability-based education (if you can reach a certain level of education, we'll pay for it), all provided by independent private providers but subsidized by the government for those meeting the criteria. This is to make sure we have population with able bodies and able minds capable of being productive citizens.

Develop effective and neutral communication and transportation networks to make sure that our economy is capable of operating efficiently, that information and resources can get from where they are to where they're needed as seamlessly as possible and we can all reap the benefits thereof.


We must tax at least as much as we spend. We must pay down our debts. We must maintain domestic peace. Beyond that, our collective money is best spent on those who need it the most, and on ensuring that they are capable of being productive, by looking after their health and education, ensuring that they have strong bodies and minds.


Look to the future:

Invest in scientific research to both straighten things out here on Earth and eventually reach beyond it, by focusing on the areas of:

- Medicine: Work on optimizing ways of keeping people alive. Fight disease, aging, and death. This has obvious immediate benefits, but is also a necessary element of the goal of long-term manned space travel.

- Energy/Climate: Work on ways of building completely self-sustaining settlements, first in more temperate climates, then gradually in more and more harsh climates: the hottest deserts, the coldest poles, eventually the bottom of the sea, and even the vacuum of space. This will allow us to mediate and weather climate change here on Earth, but is also a necessary element of the goal of long-term space colonization.

- Automation: Work on ways of automating things to do work both remotely operated and autonomously. This has obvious immediate benefits militarily and economically, but is also a necessary element of the goal of space travel and colonization.

- Propulsion: Work on ways of sending things from one place to another efficiently. This has obvious immediate benefits militarily and economically, but is also a necessary element of the goal of space travel and colonization.

Space: Combine all of the above to get us back on track for exploring, visiting, and settling the rest of the universe, and a high aspiration to aim for while enjoying all the immediate benefits that fall out of the programs necessary to accomplish it.
