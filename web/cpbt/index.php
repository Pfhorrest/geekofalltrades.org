He is a pioneer in the field of 					Pre and Perinatal therapy and of using energetic and somatic approaches to facilitate attachment and bonding.					His current practice focuses on the resolution of prenatal, birth and other early trauma and stressand developing teachable methods 					of supporting families and small groups of adults. His contribution to the field includes developing or expanding:				</p>				<p>					Dr. Castellino developed the Womb Surround Process Workshop for small groups of adults. He had discovered and developed clinical approaches 					and skill sets that carry over to family work with children and are applied in both Womb Surrounds, BEBA Family Sessions and in About Connections.  					As such BEBA, About Connections, the Womb Surround Process Workshops, Professional Training. Body into Being and Community outreach seminars and workshops 					constitute wings of integrated pre and peri-natal delivery and educational system. 				</p>				<p>					These innovations include the Castellino 7 guiding Principles for small groups and families. These principles are cornerstones for the creating safety 					and high level function and optimal growth of babies and children in the context of relationships in their families.				</p>				<p>					He has developed a teachable method for working with families and small groups of adults as an energetic relational field. 					This innovation is a major game changer for facilitating families and adults in a relational social nervous system field.					</p>				<p> 					He has developed approaches that support families and small groups of adults to efficiently and safely evolve into harmonic 					resonance and co-regulated states while supporting individuation and differentiation at the same time. Together with Mary Jackson 					home birth midwife they have developed a system for evaluating the needs of pregnant mom’s, their babies and the father that involves 					establishing “two layers of support” to the baby, the mother, the father and also the birth team. They have clinically discovered 					that when the layers of competent support are in place the mother and baby are free to find the impulses they need to birth from the inside out.				</p>				<p> 					He has worked with the primary rhythms of families and small groups of adults, has discovered and continues to do ongoing clinical 					research on the slow rhythms that govern coherence and high level attunement in relationships. Currently he measures this rhythm to 					oscillate at 5 minute cycles. This rhythm is substantially slower than the Tidal Rhythms as defined by the Osteopathic and Craniosacral 					healing disciplines. He calls these slow occulting rhythmic cycles, “relational field cycles,” and observes that the relational field cycles 					govern the innate knowing of birth, bonding and attachment.				</p>				<p> 					He has developed a series of protocols for facilitating families and small groups when the families or groups manifesting “double bind” 					paradoxical energies. These protocols are self-published as part of his professional training manual available to trainees in his professional trainings. 				</p>				<p>					Ray is doing ongoing research on the manifestation of “sequential behavioral patterns” that originate from “sequential imprinting” 					from ancestral, conception, gestation and birth experience. 				</p>				<p>					He has developed numerous integrated somatic/psychological approaches for discovering how all beings implicitly remember early pre and perinatal experiences. 					Some of these include facilitated movement, supported attachment, dynamic creative opposition, dynamic squeeze. 				</p>				<p>					Lastly, with his work with Mary Jackson, Tara Blasco and Anna Chitty he has developed and discovered several ways to anchor into universal 					resourced states that he and Anna Chitty refer to as the “Blueprint Energies.” These blueprint states of consciousness provide a basis for gently 					and safely discovering early imprint implicit somatic memories through intention, the co-regulation tempo, movement in highly cooperative relational 					fields and connected social processes. 				</p>				<p>					These approaches are all applicable for pre-nates, mothers, couples, families and small groups of adults and form the basis for his work in BEBA, 					About Connections, Womb Surround Workshops, his Foundation Trainings, Body into Being and other professional seminars.				</p>				<ul>					<li>									<p>					In addition to his work at Castellino Training, Ray is currently involved in three other projects:				</p>				<ul>					<li>						He is co-founder <a href="http://www.aboutconnections.com/">About Connections</a> with home birth midwife Mary Jackson, where they prepare families						for birth, support the birth process, do follow up integration. The methods they have developed has reduced home birth transfers						to the hospital from 20% to 3% in over 100 births. They also work with families and individuals of all ages to resolve the effects						of early imprinting.					</li>									<li>						He is the Clinical Director of <a href="http://www.beba.org">BEBA (Building and Enhancing Bonding and Attachment)</a>, a						non-profit research clinic in Ojai, CA devoted to strengthening the bonds between babies/children and their parents and						optimizing children's physical, emotional and mental development.					</li>					<li>						He co-teaches a 5-module training with Anna Chitty, RPP, BCST, SEP, ABD <a href="http://www.castellinotraining.com/bodywork">Body into Being: Understanding 						and Facilitating Attachment through Somatic and Energetic Processes.					</li>						</ul> 				<p>					Dr. Castellino is a frequent presenter at national and international					conferences including the <a href="http://www.apppah.org">Association for Pre- &amp; Peri-natal Psychology and Health</a>, the					<a href="http://www.polaritytherapy.org">American Polarity Therapy Association</a>, the					<a href="http://www.craniosacraltherapy.org">Craniosacral Therapy Association of North America</a>, and others. He was a founding					board member of the <a href="http://www.atlc.org">Alliance for Transforming the Lives of Children</a>.				</p>				<p>					He has been practicing and teaching in the healthcare field since 1970, and offering prenatal and birth therapy since 1993.				</p>				<p>(<a href="/Ray's Vitae with Publications 03-11-17.pdf">Read full curriculum vitae</a>).</p>			</div><? include $root."/includes/footer.php"; ?>
