Going beyond the mere study of the various nearly-sapient native life forms, Keius programs some nanites to make intelligent, goal-directed modifications to the genetic code of those, to see if the nanites are capable of creating sapience on demand, and thus if the Ehrban's own sapience might be an intentional creation of the Minded-Worlds.					</p>										<p>						After surprisingly little experimentation, Keius and his team are able to engineer not only one, but four different sapient species out of the various candidate species of Asira that they had already been studying. While the rest of the team are tasked with studying the extent of the sapience of those species, Keius is emboldened to try an even greater experiment: to see if the nanites can be programmed to take raw organic materials and build entirely new sapient life completely <i>de novo</i>, not based on any other pre-existing life form.					</p>										<p>						<strong>Next:</strong>						<a href="../2">							The Children of Antiquity: Part 2, Episode 2						</a>					</p>				</section><? require $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] .
