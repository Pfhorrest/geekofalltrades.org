	<h2>(6x26) The War of Antiquity: Part 3, Episode 2</h2>

	<p>
		More ships are sent to counter them, but with the time dilation field at their disposal, the Berol can replenish their losses instantaneously and indefinitely. Several flashes of time-dilation elapse in but a few moments, and an undefeatable horde of Berol ships begins to pour through the portal from Berona and across the portal network, infiltrating the galaxy, attacking all the Ehrban worlds.
	</p>

	<p>
		In desperation, Keius orders a mass retreat of any ships already in the air back toward the core worlds, back to Ehrba; and the closure of the portals from any systems the Berol have already infiltrated. But it may already be too late, for the Berol ships travel at near-luminous impulse speed just as the Ehrban ships do, so there is no hope in outrunning them.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		But with the closure of the portals the onslaught can at least by slowed to subluminal speeds; which, given galactic distances, would give Ehrba thousands of years to prepare, if they can survive those forces already en route, which are already too late to stop. So simultaneously a message is sent to the Asiron ordering an all-out attack on the Berona system and the defense of Ehrba at all costs.
