						<li>

							the Nurbal and their automatons reactivate the ancient Ehrban wormhole network and discover other survivors of the ancient war on other worlds.
							<ol>
								<li>
									In <a href="1">Part 1</a>,
									a century later, the colonists discover survivors on other worlds, and as Amouch is awakened from stasis he becomes worshipped by them as a religious icon.
									<ol>
										<li>
											In <a href="1/1">Episode 1</a>,
											Amouch is awakened from stasis after a century into a luxurious automated paradise, so that he can serve as a liason to a world of other Ehrban survivors of the ancient war.
										</li>
										<li>
											In <a href="1/2">Episode 2</a>,
											Amouch travels through the Nurbal's fledgeling wormhole network to meet the other Ehrban survivors, and begrudgingly concedes to bestow automation upon them as well.
										</li>
										<li>
											In <a href="1/3">Episode 3</a>,
											still further worlds full of surviving Ehrban are discovered, and with Amouch's mediation they are brought into political union with the Nurbal as the Quelouvan Alliance.
										</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>
									In <a href="2">Part 2</a>,
									Amouch must walk a fine line to find the proper stance to take in his new religious role in the burgeoning Quelovan Alliance of worlds.
									<ol>
										<li>
											In <a href="2/1">Episode 1</a>,
											Amouch becomes an extremely popular spiritual figure in the new Quelouvan Alliance thanks to his Meij heritage, magical abilities, and access to ancestral memories.
										</li>
										<li>
											In <a href="2/2">Episode 2</a>,
											Amouch learns that the diaspora have retained a connection to the collective-consciousness "goddess" of Geiana on Niarba, and finds that Daria and her descendents have ascended to unity with Geiana.
										</li>
										<li>
											In <a href="2/3">Episode 3</a>,
											the status of Amouch as a religious figure in the Quelouvan Alliance becomes a contentious political issue, and Amouch resolves not to exploit his influence.
										</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>
									In <a href="3">Part 3</a>,
									still more worlds full of survivors oppose the Alliance on alternately religious or technological grounds, and Amouch works delicately to mediate those disputes.
									<ol>
										<li>
											In <a href="3/1">Episode 1</a>,
											some worlds' religious vilification of Amouch puts pressure on him to outright denounce his spiritual significance, but he carefully assumes a more nuanced stance instead.
										</li>
										<li>
											In <a href="3/2">Episode 2</a>,
											some worlds object to the Alliance's widespread use of automation, but Amouch is able to help assuage their concerns without even using his religious authority.
										</li>
										<li>
											In <a href="3/3">Episode 3</a>,
											as disputes about Amouch's religious significance threaten to tear apart the Alliance, Amouch embraces his authority to settle the matter by fiat, before retiring into stasis once again.
