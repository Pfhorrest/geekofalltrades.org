	<ol>
		<li>
			In Nurbal Legacy: Part 3,
			still more worlds full of survivors oppose the Alliance on alternately religious or technological grounds, and Amouch works delicately to mediate those disputes.
			<ol>
				<li>
					In <a href="1">Episode 1</a>,
					some worlds' religious vilification of Amouch puts pressure on him to outright denounce his spiritual significance, but he carefully assumes a more nuanced stance instead.
				</li>
				<li>
					In <a href="2">Episode 2</a>,
					some worlds object to the Alliance's widespread use of automation, but Amouch is able to help assuage their concerns without even using his religious authority.
				</li>
				<li>
					In <a href="3">Episode 3</a>,
					as disputes about Amouch's religious significance threaten to tear apart the Alliance, Amouch embraces his authority to settle the matter by fiat, before retiring into stasis once again.
