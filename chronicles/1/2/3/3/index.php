						<li>
							In Meij Endaren: Part 3,
							Endaren resurrects Mav the Witch-Queen to serve as a common enemy against whom to unite the Ancients and Nurbal, and then sacrifices his own life to stop her.
							<ol>
								<li>
									In <a href="1">Episode 1</a>,
									resurrecting Mav the Witch-Queen immediately goes terribly wrong, as she chases Endaren back to the Ancients' capital and nearly destroys it.
								</li>
								<li>
									In <a href="2">Episode 2</a>,
									Mav the Witch-Queen destroys the capital of the Council of Nations, almost igniting a global thermonuclear war, until the Nurbal negotiate an alternative.
								</li>
								<li>
									In <a href="3">Episode 3</a>,
									Endaren sacrifices himself as part of a joint Ancient-Nurbal counterattack against Mav, and in the aftermath Daria and Amouch negotiate a peaceful resolution to the cold war.
