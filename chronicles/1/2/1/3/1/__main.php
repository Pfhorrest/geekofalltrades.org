	<h2>(2x25) Lievus Meij: Part 3, Episode 1</h2>

	<p>
		Though initially reluctant to engage in war against each other, Lievus and Kadia are polarized in opposite directions by the influence of their respective peoples and their reactions to how each other change. The mages of the old temple, the non-mutants, begin to see the mutants &ndash; whom they now blanketly refer to as "warlocks", even the ones in the still-domestically-civil second colony &ndash; as a kind of unholy abomination, literally soulless and godless for their lack of inherited memories and disconnection from Geiana.
	</p>

	<p>
		Though not going so far himself, Lievus comes to hold that the mutation is in objective fact counter to the intended purpose of the magic technology that his father Keius invented, which was used to unite their once-great people and prevent a war that threatened to destroy them all.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Kadia, on the other hand, sees the Geianan mages as a kind of hive-minded cult seeking to destroy all individuality, and echoes opinions passed down through the generations that what Keius did before the fall was a great evil aimed as usurping power over all Ehrban and setting himself up as a messianic figure, the one true prophet of the god that he created. With these increasingly incendiary opinions aimed at each other, peaceful negotiation between the old temple and the second colony proves impossible, and a terrible war lasting years erupts.
