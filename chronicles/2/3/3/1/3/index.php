But Metis believes that contacting the automatons of Venus is more important now than ever before, and barely manages, even with her influence as the goddess of the world, to get the three superpower to agree to allow her to oversee a joint space program to send her personally on a primitive one-way trip to Venus that only she could survive at this level of technology, to make personal contact with the automatons.					</p>										<p>						After a long harsh and lonely journey, Metis arrives on Venus and establishes contact with the automatons. Thankfully they are, as hoped and anticipated, in possession of space technology of their own, though they haven't had need to use it for thousands of years. In their spacecraft, Metis returns to Earth with an entourage of automata, just in time to disrupt the imminent nuclear armageddon by distracting the whole world with the promise of their salvation and the return to the glorious heights before the fall.					</p>										<p>						<strong>Next:</strong>						<a href="../../2/1">							Sol Resurgent: Part 2, Episode 1						</a>					</p>				</section><? require $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] .
