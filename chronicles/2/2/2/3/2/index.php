But those aliens, called the Asiron, as well as all of the other more primitives species here, were in turn created by the another race alien to that world, called the Ehrban, specifically by one of them named Keius Meij.					</p>					<p>						The Asiron considered themselves the "children" of Keius, and their AI recognizes humans as the "adopted children" of him too; more than that, it recognizes the symbol on their uniforms as his personal symbol. Dom feels vindicated that he was right that there is something much deeper than any of them know going on here, that the mere centuries-old Foundation has some kind of connection to ancient aliens from who knows how many thousands of years ago.					</p>										<p>						But more to the point at hand, the Asiron AI knows of the planet that humans are from, and wishes to protect both humanity and Earth per Keius' will, so it offers to take the Einherjar home. They gladly accept, but then learn that their help is needed first. The ship cannot take off without first securing the anti-spacecraft weapon controlled by the aquatics in the south. The Einherjar are sent on a mission by the AI to travel through the transport network to the weapon installation on the other side of the world, there to present the locals with a holographic projector the AI provides them through which it will communicate with them, and convince them &ndash; backed by the Einherjar threat of force if necessary &ndash; to surrender remote control of the weapon to the AI. With that accomplished, the Einherjar return to the ship through the transport network, and the enormous ship lifts off of the planet and heads toward the wormhole in the outer reaches of the star system.					</p>					<p>						<strong>Next:</strong>						<a href="../3">							Veil of the Foundation: Part 3, Episode 3						</a>					</p>				</section><? require $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] .
