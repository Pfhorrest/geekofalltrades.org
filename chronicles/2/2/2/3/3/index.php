					<h2>(1x24) Veil of the Foundation: Part 3, Episode 3</h2>

					<p>
						Reaching the wormhole again, the Einherjar attempt to communicate through the ansible link in the wormhole with the Foundation at Sol, redacting their earlier report of threats with an updated mission report. But the Foundation is not willing to allow a powerful alien ship run by an unvetted artificial intelligence access to Sol, so they refuse to reopen the wormhole.
					</p>

					<p>
						When Captain Thorir says that they will just have to come the long way instead, the Foundation insists that they must not. The Foundation suggest that, if possible, the Einherjar can arrange to mind-upload back into Virtuality through the ansible link, the same as they downloaded through it to their ship in the first place, there to live out the rest of their lives; but in any case they are forbidden from leading aliens back to Sol. Dom is of course the first to call bullshit on that plan, but this time, the rest of the crew begrudgingly agree with him.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The Foundation orders Amitabha to take whatever means necessary to prevent the alien ship from reaching Earth, but at the Einherjar' request the Asiron AI is able to incapacitate Amitabha while preserving her mind intact. Then, even knowing that they are likely to receive an unfriendly welcome when they finally arrive, they head back for home the long way.
