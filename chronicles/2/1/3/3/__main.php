				<li>
					In <a href="1">Episode 1</a>,
					only a few Foundation agents remain on Earth while the rest of the immortals relocate, and as they watch mortal social conditions deteriorate, a few of them decide to act alone.
				</li>

					In <a href="2">Episode 2</a>,
					rogue Foundation agents covertly recruit well-educated but politically skeptical people from the nationalist world powers to begin building a new society in the Pacific Ocean.
				</li>
				<li>
					In <a href="3">Episode 3</a>,
					the growth of the Pacific Islands International Coalition attracts the attention of the rest of the Foundation, to the detriment of the rogue agents who started it.
