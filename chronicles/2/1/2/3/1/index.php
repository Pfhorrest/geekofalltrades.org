They look first at equatorial Africa, but travelling that way to scout it out, they find southern Geptian civilization already encroaching too close on the area.					</p>										<p>						They send another expedition into the east, passing through the flourishing civilization of India on their way back toward the site of their first failed attempt. Though that land is now drowned, there are other islands that would be suitable, but they discover that though the people of those islands are themselves primitive both the Indian civilization and a burgeoning civilization on Auei itself are both quickly enroaching on those islands by sea.					</p>										<p>						After the expedition returns again to Europe report this news, the Pantheon decide that the only place remotely remote enough must be on the far side of the world, in the southwestern continent that mortals would come to call America.					</p>										<p>						<strong>Next:</strong>						<a href="../2">							Pantheon Exodus: Part 3, Episode 2						</a>					</p>				</section><? require $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] .
