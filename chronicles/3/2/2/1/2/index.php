With that ability he subborns the normally reticent wizards of Chalmany to his side, and with their combined power at his disposal he conquers his own land, betraying and killing his kind-hearted father in the process.					</p>					<p>						Thomas tries to oppose the prince, turning his own considerable magical prowess to the task.
