					<h2>(1x10) Nadir of the Darklight: Part 1, Episode 1</h2>

					<p>
						The ghost of the wizard Thomas, wandering incorporeally as his body is magically preserved to prevent his regeneration, searches for daring rebels willing to help free him and join in a revolution against the Chalman army. He regales them with the story of how he Inadvertently began the war that the Chalmans are even now marching on, and how he cannot rest, even in death, until he is able to right that mistake:
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Years before the humble farmer John would be recruited into an unjust war against the orcs of the west, a magic-user from the orcish lands known as "the Pseudo-Witch", reckoned by most of her countrymen a witch of the warlock race but in fact something much older, guides a timid but brave orc chieftain to a secret location high in the mountains. There can be found a gem of immense power, that of the moon-goddess called Ice, able to quell the passions and calm the soul of both its bearer and of others. With it the orc chieftain aims to ameliorate the constant wars of the warlock warlords who rule over the western lands, a mission the Pseudo-Witch supports, and in that mission he quickly finds success.
					</p>

					<p>
						But as news of this reaches the lands of the east, the kings of people who reckon themselves human come to fear the power of a unified orc country. Turning to their wizard viziers for advice on how to combat this threat, they learn of another gem, that imbued with the power of the sun-goddess Fire, which a rogue wizard named Thomas has been trying to mount an expedition to recover for some time. (Thomas explains to those to whom he is narrating this story: he had hoped that someone wielding the Gem of Fire over the normally aloof and apathetic wizards might be able to finally move them to actually do something good for the world). None are able to find this Thomas to lead them to this great power, so the various kingdoms begin a race to search the mountains for it themselves.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Fearing that the worst of them will find it and use it for great evil, contrary to his own intentions, Thomas himself approaches one of the few kings who has not set out a quest for the gem, the king of Chalmany, and says that he knows of its location and would like to entrust it to this king for safekeeping. Seeing the prudence in that, the gentle king sends his son the prince, and a small contingent, with Thomas into the mountains to retrieve the gem.
