They are lead through a thick jungle in which they would be lost if not for the Orcish guides, who Murdock does not entirely trust until they are lead at last to the Vampire Queen's remote lair in the farthest north. 					</p>					<p>						Meanwhile the Elvish forces, victorious on the northern battlefield save the loss of their king, are forced to return to their homeland due to the threat posed by the Orcish rebellion in the West, nearer to their home than to the human lands in the East, still quibbling about what stance to take on the matter. The Elves, not strong enough to stand against the entire West's combined Orcs by themselves, implore the Church to once again unite all of the East and lead a force to put down the Orcish rebellion in the West, out of the mutual self-interest of both themselves and their Elvish allies. 					</p>					<p>						<strong>Next:</strong>						<a href="../2">							Rising of the Darklight: Part 3, Episode 2						</a>					</p>				</section><? require $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] .
