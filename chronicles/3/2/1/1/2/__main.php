	<h2>(2x02) Falling of the Darklight: Part 1, Episode 2</h2>

	<p>
		At the start of that new Sphidia, the love of the Eldest, the one reckoned Queen, walked among the other Old Ones together in the one protected realm. But she had long ago suffered countless ages of torture unspeakable, torture for which the Eldest held himself responsible, and it had driven her mad. Her existence was now one of continuous self-sustained suffering, which she in turn inflicted upon all those she met. The Eldest was unsure whether it was right to allow her to go on living a life possibly worse than death, and to his closest confidants in Sphidia he related his failed plans to rebirth a healed form of her to make that decision herself, to choose to either take on the memory of that torment and strive to bear it with sanity intact, or else to discard that life and continue on to a new one. But in the absence of that option, his reborn Queen perishing along with the old world leaving only this tortured old wraith of the Queen behind, the Eldest could not bear to end her his own hand.

		In the old world of tiered realms, those who could not bear the Queen's madness had been spared from it, safe in realms reserved for the weak and timid, while she ruled the realm of the strongest. But now with only one realm preseved, her wrath was continually inflicted on many who would wish to avoid it; and though all the Old Ones were immortal, still they could suffer from her attacks, a suffering as painful as death, but without the release thereof to follow. With a heavy heart for his lost love's soul, but knowing he must do right by all the other souls in his care, the Eldest was forced to banish the Queen to another, smaller realm, to which any who wished could visit, but from which she could not leave.

		For the Old Ones that was better, but still many of them would come into the Queen's realm to challenge her strength, and so her life was one of constant battle. That was as it had been in the old world, but now with his eye fixed upon only this small remnant, and his love foremost in it, the Eldest could not stand to see her suffer in madness perpetually. So he sealed off her realm to the Old Ones, leaving it open only to himself and to the goddesses, whom he tasked with cultivating virtues and hopefully sanity in his lost love, however long it may take.
