			In Life in Another World: Part 3,
			further ethical questions arise about the interface between uploaded and artificial minds in the virtual world, and robotic bodies in the physical world.
			<ol>
				<li>
					In <a href="1">Episode 1</a>,
					some deceased users like Xiuying want to interface with robot bodies to roam the physical world, running up against taboos against fully autonomous robots.
				</li>
				<li>
					In <a href="2">Episode 2</a>,
					with uploaded minds controlling robot bodies now, questions arise about whether AI characters doing so as well would violate the ban on fully autonomous robots.
				</li>
				<li>
					In <a href="3">Episode 3</a>,
					further questions arise about whether copies of uploaded minds modified to no longer think of themselves as persons could operate robot bodies in lieu of fully autonomous robots.
