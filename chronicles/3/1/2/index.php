					<h2>Life in Another World</h2>
					
					<ol>
						<li>
							In Life In Another World,
							after a century of virtual afterlife, many questions begin to arise about the full implications of mind-uploading, as Met continues to torture herself into the pits of virtual hell.
							<ol>
								<li>
									In <a href="1">Part 1</a>,
									questions abound about artificial intelligence personhood and the ethics of creating, duplicating, and modifying uploaded human minds.
									<ol>
										<li>
											In <a href="1/1">Episode 1</a>,
											some human users of Virtuality begin to think of the AI characters as people, and questions about their moral and legal personhood arise.
										</li>
										<li>
											In <a href="1/2">Episode 2</a>,
											some users like Tamara want to have children in Virtuality, raising questions of what minds would go into such babies and whether it's OK to make virtual people.
										</li>
										<li>
											In <a href="1/3">Episode 3</a>,
											the possibility of duplicating and modifying uploading minds raises question about the moral, legal, and practical limits that should be placed on such activities.
										</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>
									In <a href="2">Part 2</a>,
									Tom and Xiu end up working together to redeem the mad so-called "Queen of Hell" for whom the virtual world was constructed.
									<ol>
										<li>
											In <a href="2/1">Episode 1</a>,
											Xiuying and other concerned users begin a social program to help redeem other users self-consigned to "hell", including the so-called "queen" thereof, Met.
										</li>
										<li>
											In <a href="2/2">Episode 2</a>,
											Tom is among the more combat-oriented users to join the redemption program, and he fights his way into the depths of "hell" where he mets its queen, Met.
										</li>
										<li>
											In <a href="2/3">Episode 3</a>,
											Tom guides a curious lover of his down to meet the Queen of Hell, pursued by that lover's coworkers under Xio, who in turn abandons hope for the Queen's redemption.
										</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>
									In <a href="3">Part 3</a>,
									further ethical questions arise about the interface between uploaded and artificial minds in the virtual world, and robotic bodies in the physical world.
									<ol>
										<li>
											In <a href="3/1">Episode 1</a>,
											some deceased users like Xiuying want to interface with robot bodies to roam the physical world, running up against taboos against fully autonomous robots.
										</li>
										<li>
											In <a href="3/2">Episode 2</a>,
											with uploaded minds controlling robot bodies now, questions arise about whether AI characters doing so as well would violate the ban on fully autonomous robots.
										</li>
										<li>
											In <a href="3/3">Episode 3</a>,
											further questions arise about whether copies of uploaded minds modified to no longer think of themselves as persons could operate robot bodies in lieu of fully autonomous robots.
