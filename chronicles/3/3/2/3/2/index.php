The actual virtual reality itself can be completely bypassed, and the living human can simply remote-control a synthetic body exactly the way that the Sphidi do, the very same synthetic bodies in fact.					</p>					<p>						Tom and Xiu work together with the automata to provide public access to this technology. Adoption is slow at first because of general mistrust of the Sphidi, but once it begins it quickly accelerates. The technology is absolutely transformative of human society: soon nearly everyone spends most of their time biologically at home connected to an interface, through which they roam around outside in their perfect, adaptable, replaceable synthetic bodies, indistinguishable from the Sphidi around them.					</p>										<p>						<strong>Next:</strong>						<a href="../3">							Virtuality Incarnate: Part 3, Episode 3						</a>					</p>				</section><? require $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] .
