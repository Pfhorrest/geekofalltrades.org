The girlfriend and I had a long chat about this after seeing it this weekend, and this is more or less what we settled on:

- None of the characters are worth caring about, especially the older brother character. To fix that, we have the entire family go on vacation together, and get imperiled together and fear for each other, making us care about them all more. The boring older brother character gets replaced with an older sister (for gender balance) who is some kind of outdoorsman (to make her an interesting useful character). As the family leaves for the vacation, we see the parents fighting, both because of the usual vacation stress but also showing us what it is about each other that's causing them to get divorced (which we don't know yet, as canon).

- When they first get to the park, we get a nice long "ooh ahh wow" sequence of them doing all the cool things at the park, which we very briefly got to see here and there in the canon movie. This also serves to establish the settings for later, because after the ooh and ahh will come the running and the screaming back through all the places we got to see functioning as intended in these early scenes.

- Claire used to be a badass adventurer type herself, which is how the older sister got into it, and what brought her to work at Jurassic World to begin with, and she and Owen were a couple back in those days. Then she got promoted to management and became the fussy businesswoman character from the canon movie, and Owen lost interest in her. We don't know it at first (or most of that backstory), but she kind of hates what her job has become now and wishes she was still doing cool stuff and not prancing around in high heels, but it's her job...

- There is no secret military anything, there are no villains. It's an open fact (to the staff of the park) that they're also working on weaponizing dinosaurs. Owen is technically part of that project but doesn't really like that fact. He likes training the raptors but doesn't like what they're being trained for, and especially doesn't want to work with any of the genetically modified monstrosities.

- The Indominus Rex is not a gigantic dinosaur. It's the smaller, useful version that the military was actually going to make use of, and there are multiple of them. They escape not because the park staff are carrying multiple idiot balls, but because they are smart enough to actually trick their way out of their pen without the humans having to be complete idiots.

- The Indomini, in addition to hunting for sport and generally causing mayhem, figure out ways to release other dinosaurs from their enclosures, both to fuck with those other dinosaurs and to generally cause mayhem for the island. They are smart enough, however, not to release things bigger and badder than themselves, like the T-rex.

- There aren't villains, but there is still an interpersonal conflict, between the pragmatic military side (represented by Owen) who wants to just kill the dinosaurs from aircraft immediately to save lives, and the greedy business side (represented by Claire) who want to preserve the dinosaurs even if it risks lives in order to save money for the company. Owen is disgusted with what Claire has become, but she doesn't have much of a defense of her actions besides that it's her job to make decisions like these and protect their investors, but she doesn't seem very happy about it herself.

- As previously mentioned, the family end up stuck out on the far end of the tour (in the hamster balls), and have to work their way back to the resort through all the places we previously got to see them enjoying (like that wonderful kayak trip down a stegosaur-lined river), both avoiding the Indomini and other dinosaurs on the loose that aren't supposed to be. Through their interactions, we actually come to care about them; the mother and father show sides of themselves that help repair their failing marriage, the older daughter proves herself to her mother who has thus far in life disapproved of her unfeminine interests, and has a bit of a power struggle with the dad who tries to assume a protective leadership role but just isn't as up the task as the older daughter is, but the father still gets to be protective of the younger son, whose knowledge of dinosaurs proves useful to their survival.

- Most of the climax goes as in canon, modulo the changes already mentioned, with the notable exception of a moment when Claire decides she's had enough with doing what her job tells her to do, has a wardrobe change into more pragmatic boots and pants, gets on a motorcycle and lures the T-rex out of its enclosure to defeat the Indomini (sort of as in canon, but more realistically). But now there's a T-rex on the loose, which causes problems similar to the singular Indominus from the canon movie. Owen's trained raptors are then brought out to take down the T-rex, ending up backing it into the Mosasaur enclosure as in canon.

- Owen is impressed with Claire's return to her old badass self, and they reconcile. The parents decide to maybe try not to get divorced. The whole family gets closer for having survived this harrowing ordeal together.
