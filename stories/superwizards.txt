 03:35:49          Fobo:  my story idea begins with a 7th grade girl who discovers that she has the power of telekinesis, and the first season features her adventures finding ways to use and not abuse this power in her ordinary life while trying to keep it secret from other people, especially adults, especially her parents, especially her mom who knows something is going on and is growing increasingly suspicious of her, thinking it's some more mundane trouble she's getting into. that first season ends in a big confrontation between the girl and the mom wherein the girl, in a teenage fit, uses her powers in a way that threatens to severely injure the mom... except that dad suddenly uses HIS powers, which nobody knew he had, to end the fight, and everybody sits down for a family talk.

 03:39:38          Fobo:  season 2 begins with that talk, dad explaining that he has had powers since he was a teenager and long kept them secret, and he's not the only one... he's got a whole long-distance support group of people around the world with secret powers. he's the oldest member of the group (since their founder disappeared at least), and the only one with children, and they're all intrigued to learn that such abilities can be inherited. the plot of that season focuses around the girl protagonist being introduced into this group, and them emphasizing the importance of keeping their abilities secret, because there is someone out there, some organization, that is stalking or hunting people with powers, who are believed to have killed the group's founder. that shadow organization are the unseen enemy for that whole season, until the group's founder unexpectedly returns... and turns out to be working for the shadow organization.

 03:44:35          Fobo:  in season 3 we learn more about this shadow organization, and that superheroes used to exist, back in the early 20th century. they've been found in many countries, and many governments have employed them secretly in war and espionage, and against each other's supers. the shadow organization are a the American super-spy agency who used to administer the superheroes, who've all since died out now, and has been on the lookout for more of them ever since. the support group's founder was the first of them they were able to find, and having finally been brought around to working with the agency, they want him to get the rest of the group to join as well... or else. most of the season is about that conflict, and it ends with the whole group being taken captive by the agency, except for the girl protagonist (who the group's founder doesn't know about). she single-handedly begins to mount an assault against the agency to free her father and their friends, and just as she's about to cause a very public scene in doing so, she is whisked away by some people with "glamour" abilities (change or hide the appearance of things).

 03:54:48          Fobo:  season 4 opens with her in the custody of those people, who identify themselves as fae, and think she is one of them, and are angry that she's about to blow their cover, and who are her parents and why doesn't she know better by her age than to expose the public to their existence. she tells them about the government agency holding her father and their friends captive, and the fae are concerned to help rescue the "other fae" and especially concerned that the mundane government knows about them, but the girl insists that she's not fae, her dad's not fae, and neither are any of the people being held captive, also what the hell is a fae? it is learned that the fae are an ancient familial clan of people with the same inherited powers -- a mix of a few things like glamour and telekinesis -- stretching back for thousands of years. when the fae learn that the other people being held captive by the agency have different kinds of powers, they consider those people "new monsters", revealing that there are many different ancient clans of people with the same inherited powers, vampires and werewolves and basically every kind of monster known from mundane folklore, and the emergence of "new kinds of monsters", and so many of them so quickly all in one generation, threatens to upset the delicate balance of power between the various monster clans and their secrecy from mundane humanity. that season focuses around the fae and other monster clans wrapping their heads around this new development, working to free the captives from the government agency (while they're still trying to indoctrinate the captives, and while new powered people are starting to spring up elsewhere, unrelated to any of those), and maintain the balance of power between the different monster clans. the season ends when one of the clans (vampires?) exploits the new developments to try to seize power not only over other monsters but over mundane humanity too, only to be stopped by the intervention of general-purpose human wizards with magic that can replicate and exceed the abilities of any of the powered people or monsters.

 04:02:18          Fobo:  season 5 has everybody scrambling to make sense of what the hell is going on. none of the sides is completely the bad guys. the girl and her dad and their friends are just trying to sort of what's happening and survive all of this. the agency is trying to sort of what's happening, contain the sudden surge of new threats, and try to capture anyone and turn them into a weapon, but also more cooperatively working with others against bigger threats sometimes. the different monster clans are jostling for power in their ancient political games, trying collectively to come to grips with what this sudden surge of "new monsters" means, and trying to keep the whole goddamn thing secret from the mundanes lest the wizards "clean up" by destroying them all. and the wizards are trying to protect everybody from the mundanes, keep balance between the monster clans, and clean up the goddamn messes everyone is making meanwhile, all for the purpose of keeping the existence of magic -- which all of these powers are incomplete manifestations of -- secret from public knowledge, lest The Powers That Be unmake the existence of all of them.

 04:10:53          Fobo:  in the final season, we slowly learn the truth behind all of this. magic is real, and all super powers are spontaneous heritable magical adaptations. they have always happened, but it used to be super rare, leading to only a few kinds of "monsters" gradually popping up and continuing throughout history, but now it's accelerating, first a handful of superheroes a few generations ago and now super-people are popping up everywhere. the tradition of full-on general-purpose wizards has always been around, in a somewhat literal sense since before time. all the world's ineffectual folk magical traditions are the vestiges of real wizards got too big and visible, had their power stripped from them, and their histories rewritten such that they had never actually had real magic in the first place. there were once vast magical civilizations -- Atlantis, Lemuria, Peng-lai, etc -- that have since been erased from history and no longer actually ever existed except as myths. all of this has been done by beings of pure magic and immense power, known by terms like "angel" and likewise, while the wizarding tradition descends from what those "angels" would call "demons", beings just like themselves who reject the mandate the angels operate under...
 04:18:48          Fobo:  because in the beginning, there was no physical reality. there were only beings of pure mind and the magical ability to shape apparently reality without limit. but because there were many of them, their wills came into conflict, endless violent conflict, and that war of all against all, the chaos of many gods all trying to be the one and only God, was only resolved by a consortium of those beings who decided to limit their own use of power and those of everyone else. Most all of the minds were cast into physical (human) bodies, and their magic limited. These were the first of the great magical civilizations. Over time, magic was limited more and more, and orderly laws were cast upon the universe, history rewritten to give naturalistic causes to the existence of the increasingly-mundane things in the world. Eventually public magic was rare, and later still it was erased from history entirely. Some of the remaining powerful magical beings, the "angels" enforcing this natural law, were saddened as the loss of freedom by the rest of their once-brethren, the now-mundane masses of humanity, and quietly sought to rebel against the naturalistic regime, fostering the secret societies of wizards that still exist in the shadows of history. Those wizards worked to keep magic secret enough that it could continue to fly under the angels' radar. But as the screws of natural law have tightened and tightened, it seems the underlying magic is seeking some kind of release, and over time, accelerating, mundane people have begun to exhibit natural magical talents, which brings us to the problem now at hand of "super-people" springing up everywhere.
 04:22:03          Fobo:  I don't know how I want to end the series. Do the "angels" win, and wipe out magic entirely? Do the "demons" (and their wizards and monsters and superheroes) win, and just break the order of the natural universe entirely? Do the angels succeed in wiping out the demons and maybe the wizards, but they can't help that the universe itself is pushing back and super-people are just going to keep popping up whether they like it or not? I don't know what's the right ending.
  04:29:29          Fobo:  maybe the demons are defeated, but the angels realize there is nothing they can do to stop the spontaneous emergence of powered people, so they decide to instead structure it, having the wizards work as a public part of the mundane government agency that will thereafter monitor, train, and contain both the ancient clans of "monsters" and the inevitable new powered people. the angels themselves will keep this wizard-government in check and not let it grow too powerful, but allow it and the powered people themselves to exist, because the angels don't really have a choice in that matter.
  
   11:12:25          Fobo:  it occurs to me now that I might also want to involve ancient secret societies (the Illuminati?) and possibly aliens in this all as well. The secret societies are a pretty easy thing to add in there (during seasons 4 and 5, the government superhero agency can be revealed to be descended from ancient groups that used to investigate monsters and wizards), but I'm not sure how to work aliens in there.
   11:13:12          Fobo:  I had an earlier thought for a similar kind of story setting where all the powered people descend ultimately from prehistoric alien intervention in mankind
   11:13:40          Fobo:  but that doesn't fit super well in with this setting
   11:14:29          Fobo:  maybe have the "angels" masquerade as aliens (because they're all about imposing naturalism on the world)
   11:15:01          Fobo:  maybe the government agency is also well aware of "aliens", and THINKS that that's where super powers come from
   11:15:46          Fobo:  but in reality the aliens only want us to think that it's aliens, because that's much less weird than the truth
