				<h1>Philosophy Study Guide</h1>
				<p>
					This document is a study guide for philosophy as a whole. It will offer several different orders in which the subject can be studied, but in all of them it will proceed breadth-first, giving students a broad but shallow overview of the whole subject to begin with, and then a deeper focus on narrower parts of the subject afterward.
				</p>

				<p>
					The main sources of study to be used will be three online encyclopedias. They are, in decreasing order of quality:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu">The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a> ("SEP")
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://iep.utm.edu/">The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a> ("IEP")
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy">Wikipedia</a> ("WP")
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					These sources will generally give their own sources in turn, the primary texts written by these philosophers about these topics, where students can then continue their philosophical study in further depth.
				</p>

				<p>The four different orders for studying philosophy this guide will offer are:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Two historical orders:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b><a href="#ancient-modern">From ancient philosophy to modern philosophy</a></b>,
								which is how most introductory classes on philosophy begin; but some of the ancient problems or their solutions might seem outdated to the modern student.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b><a href="#modern-ancient">From modern philosophy to ancient philosophy</a></b>,
								which begins with more current states of affairs in ongoing philosophical inquiry; but may be too technical and so difficult for a beginning student.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
					And two topical orders:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b><a href="#applied-theoretical">From applied philosophy to theoretical philosophy</a></b>,
								beginning with topics that new students might find most interesting such as the meaning of life, political philosophy, and the relationship between science and religion, and working down to the more technical theoretical aspects of philosophy.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b><a href="#theoretical-applied">From theoretical philosophy to applied philosophy</a></b>,
								beginning with the logically prior technical topics like language, art, and mathematics, and building up from there to the aspects of philosophy that new students are likely to find more interesting.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

					<h2 id="ancient-modern">From ancient philosophy to modern philosophy</h2>

					<p>Three very prominent philosophers serve as landmarks in the history of philosophy, through its traditional division into Ancient, Medieval, and Modern periods:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Socrates</b>
							(
								<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/socrates/">SEP</a>
							|
								<a href="https://iep.utm.edu/socrates/">IEP</a>
							|
								<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates">WP</a>
							)
							was the founding figure of the classical era of ancient philosophy.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Thomas Aquinas</b>
							(
								<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/">SEP</a>
							|
								<a href="https://iep.utm.edu/aquinas/">IEP</a>
							|
								<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas">WP</a>
							)
							was the founder of what became the dominant school of medieval philosophy.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Immanuel Kant</b>
							(
								<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/">SEP</a>
							|
								<a href="https://iep.utm.edu/kantview/">IEP</a>
							|
								<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant">WP</a>
							)
							was the latest figure crucial to both major branches of contemporary late modern philosophy.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						The history of philosophy has repeatedly seen the study of the subject split between two major competing schools of thought, and each of these landmark philosophers represents a punctuation of such division: a unification of the preceding two schools of thought, and the common ground from which the following two schools of thought diverge.
					</p>
					<p>
						A deeper level study can thus begin with the philosophers with whom those preceding schools of thought culminated, and those who initiated the following schools of thought after each of these landmark philosophers.
					</p>
					<ul>

					<h2 id="applied-theoretical">From applied philosophy to theoretical philosophy</h2>
					
					<p>
						The subtopics within philosophy can be arranged in relation to each other along a number of different axes, and two of the most important axes are the descriptive-to-prescriptive axis, and the theoretical-to-applied axis. These may seem superficially alike but they can be reckoned separately, orthogonally to each other. The descriptive topics have to do with things like existence, mind, knowledge, and education; while the prescriptive topics have to do with things like value, will, justice, and governance. Meanwhile, the theoretical topics have to do with things like the language with which we make claims about such things, either descriptive or prescriptive, and when and how such claims could be reckoned correct; while the applied topics have to do with how both those descriptive and prescriptive matters factor into how to live our lives in practice.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>The meaning of life</b>
							(
								<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/life-meaning/">SEP</a>
							|
								<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_of_life">WP</a>
							)
							is the big applied topic that draws many people into philosophy to begin with, into which many if not all of the other philosophical topics factor.
						</li>
						<br />
						<li>
							<b>Ethics</b>
							(
								<a href="https://iep.utm.edu/ethics/">IEP</a>
							|
								<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics">WP</a>
							)
							is the broad and general prescriptive topic, the philosophical inquiry into what is moral.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Metaphysics</b>
							(
								<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/metaphysics/">SEP</a>
							|
								<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics">WP</a>
							)
							is the broad and general descriptive topic, the philosophical inquiry into what is real.
						</li>
						<br />
						<li>
							<b>Philosophy of language</b>
							(
								<a href="https://iep.utm.edu/lang-phi/">IEP</a>
							|
								<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_language">WP</a>
							)
							is perhaps the most theoretical topic within philosophy, being entirely about the meaning of words, in contrast to the meaning of life.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Near each of the poles of the theoretical-applied axis are other closely-related fields separated along the descriptive-prescriptive axis; and on each side of that descriptive-prescriptive axis proper, there are multiple fields separated not only along the theoretical-applied axis, but also along a third axis from <em>what</em> is real, moral, knowable, or just, to <em>who</em> are the subjects and institutions of reality, morality, knowledge, and justice.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Empowerment</b>
							(
								<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empowerment">WP</a>
							)
							is a topic closely related to meaningfulness in life, but focusing more on the prescriptive side, about inspiring the will to actively pursue the good, the moral, or the just, and so to become fully free or self-directed.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Enlightenment</b>
							(
								<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_(spiritual)">WP</a>
