Besides my education in arts and technologies, I also have a degree in philosophy, and my own philosophical system centers entirely around applying that person-centric pragmatism to all areas of life.						</p>						<p>							I love to learn, and I’m a very fast learner, drawing on my wide breadth of experience to gain fluency on new skills quickly, and strengthen those I already have. I also love to teach, to help others round out and polish up their skill sets.						</p>						<p>							Academic and cognitive aptitude tests consistently score me around the top 1%. Personality tests rank me highly on conscientiousness, openness, and agreeableness.						</p>						<p>							I thrive in a support role, helping others to achieve their goals. But I’m also comfortable in a leadership position, as I see leadership itself, done right, as a kind of a support role.						</p>						<p>							I work extremely well independently, and have done so for most of my life. But I also love it when my work can be part of a larger team effort, or when I can bring together the products of other people’s work.						</p>						<p>							I can turn around tasks very quickly, and love to keep my to-do list clear and stay ready to jump on the next task immediately. But I also love any opportunity to spend much time working out every last detail of a complex project to perfection.						</p>						<p>							I am looking for a steady career where the skills and experience I already have are enough as they are from day one, and where there are opportunities to learn and grow more in the future.						</p>					</section>					<section id="skills">						<h3>Skills</h3>						<section id="graphics">							<h4>Graphic Design</h4>							<p class="description">								<a href="/graphics">									View Portfolio								</a>							</p>							<ul>								<li>									Photoshop <sup>(since 1996)</sup>								</li>								<li>									InDesign <sup>(since 2002)</sup>								</li>								<li>									Illustrator <sup>(since 2003)</sup>								</li>								<li>									Figma <sup>(since 2021)</sup>								</li>							</ul>						</section>						<section id="web">							<h4>Web Development</h4>							<p class="description">								<a href="/web">									View Portfolio								</a>							</p>							<section id="front-end">								<h5>Front-End</h5>								<ul>									<li>										HTML <sup>(since 1996)</sup>									</li>									<li>										CSS <sup>(since 2008)</sup>									</li>									<li>										SASS <sup>(since 2011)</sup>									</li>									<li>										Javascript <sup>(since 2010)</sup>									</li>									<li>										jQuery <sup>(since 2011)</sup>									</li>									<li>										ReactJS <sup>(since 2021)</sup>									</li>								</ul>							</section>							<section id="back-end">								<h5>Back-End</h5>								<ul>									<li>										PHP <sup>(since 2002)</sup>									</li>									<li>										SQL <sup>(since 2008)</sup>									</li>									<li>										Ruby on Rails <sup>(since 2011)</sup>									</li>									<li>										NodeJS <sup>(since 2021)</sup>									</li>								</ul>							</section>						</section>					</section>					<section id="work">						<h3>Work Experience</h3>						<section id="monterey">							<h4>Art Director</h4>							<p class="description">at The Monterey Company, 2012-2020</p>							<p>Graphic design primarily in Illustrator for production of lapel pins, coins, medallions, and all varieties of art on metal, both production-ready technical art for manufacturing and photorealistic proofs for customers; design and oversight of workflows and collaboration processes to coordination between sales representatives, external art resources, and manufacturers; and miscellaneous graphic and web work for internal use.</p>							<p>(They are located at 35 SW Century Dr #110, Bend, OR 97702.
