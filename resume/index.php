I also love to teach, to help others round out and polish up their skill sets.						</p>						<p>							Academic and cognitive aptitude tests consistently score me around the top 1%. Personality tests rank me highly on conscientiousness, openness, and agreeableness, and just slightly on the introverted side.						</p>						<p>							I’m happy to be wherever in an organizational structure I can best serve, whether that’s learning from and supporting those more experienced than me, teaching and guiding those less experienced, or somewhere in the middle.						</p>						<p>							I thrive in a support role, helping others to achieve their goals. But I am also an ideas guy with high-level thoughts on ways to improve the overall process. I see leadership itself, done right, as a kind of a support role.						</p>						<p>							I work best independently when it comes to doing the actual work, but I love it when my work can be part of a larger team effort, or when I can bring together the products of other people’s work.						</p>						<p>							I can turn around tasks I know how to do very quickly, and love to jump on new tasks as soon as they come in. But I also love any opportunity to spend much deep thought working out every last detail of a complex project to perfection.						</p>						<p>							I am equal parts abstract and practical, big-picture and detail-oriented, striving always to embody the best of both sides of every such dichotomy.						</p>					</section>					<section id="skills">						<h3>Skills</h3>						<section id="graphics">							<h4>Graphic Design</h4>							<p class="description">								<a href="/graphics">									View Portfolio								</a>							</p>							<ul>								<li>									Photoshop <sup>(since 1996)</sup>								</li>								<li>									InDesign <sup>(since 2002)</sup>								</li>								<li>									Illustrator <sup>(since 2003)</sup>								</li>							</ul>						</section>						<section id="web">							<h4>Web Development</h4>							<p class="description">								<a href="/web">									View Portfolio								</a>							</p>							<section id="front-end">								<h5>Front-End</h5>								<ul>									<li>										HTML <sup>(since 1996)</sup>									</li>									<li>										CSS <sup>(since 2008)</sup>									</li>									<li>										SASS <sup>(since 2011)</sup>									</li>									<li>										Javascript <sup>(since 2010)</sup>									</li>									<li>										jQuery <sup>(since 2011)</sup>									</li>									<li>										ReactJS <sup>(since 2021)</sup>									</li>								</ul>							</section>							<section id="back-end">								<h5>Back-End</h5>								<ul>									<li>										PHP <sup>(since 2002)</sup>									</li>									<li>										SQL <sup>(since 2008)</sup>									</li>									<li>										Ruby on Rails <sup>(since 2011)</sup>									</li>									<li>										NodeJS <sup>(since 2021)</sup>									</li>								</ul>							</section>						</section>					</section>					<section id="work">						<h3>Work Experience</h3>						<section id="monterey">							<h4>Art Director</h4>							<p class="description">at The Monterey Company, 2012-2020</p>							<p>Graphic design primarily in Illustrator for production of lapel pins, coins, medallions, and all varieties of art on metal, both production-ready technical art for manufacturing and photorealistic proofs for customers; design and oversight of workflows and collaboration processes to coordination between sales representatives, external art resources, and manufacturers; and miscellaneous graphic and web work for internal use.</p>						</section>						<section id="cvtech">							<h4>Software Engineer</h4>							<p class="description">at CVTech, 2011-2012</p>							<p>Development of an ecommerce platform in Ruby on Rails, JQuery/Javascript, CSS &amp; HTML, as well as motion graphic advertisements and other graphics work for web and print.</p>						</section>						<section id="stratus">							<h4>Graphic &amp; Web Designer</h4>							<p class="description">at Stratus Media Group, 2010-2011</p>							<p>Lead design, development, and management of most company websites; graphic and web design for screen and print to serve both marketing and operational needs, including logos, advertisements, flyers, posters, and event collateral such as tickets and signage; minor video and audio editing; copy editing of texts for publication; and assistance and advice in installation and maintenance of IT infrastructure.</p>						</section>						<section id="castellinos">							<h4>Technical &amp; Administrative Assistant</h4>							<p class="description">at Castellino Training &amp; The BEBA Clinic, 2002-2012</p>							<p>Creative and technical responsibilities included graphic design and page layout, web design and administration, database design and administration, computer and network maintenance, minor video production in Final Cut Pro and iMovie, and proofreading and editing of publications.</p>							<p>Administrative duties included recording payments in Quicken and the company's FileMaker database, preparing deposits, and taking them to the bank; running reports and preparing spreadsheets on financial and statistical data; check-in, check-out and billing of clients; copying MiniDV tapes to video DVDs for sale and archival; processing orders for resale products; bulk mailings (both postal and email); shipping and receiving; payroll; scheduling; filing and other organization; and miscellaneous errands.
