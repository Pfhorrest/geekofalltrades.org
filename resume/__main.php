	<h3>Soft Skills</h3>
	<p class="description"></p>
	<p>
		I am equal parts abstract and practical, big-picture and detail-oriented, striving always to embody the best of both sides of every such dichotomy. Besides my education in arts and technologies, I also have a degree in philosophy, and my own philosophical system centers entirely around pursuing such a golden mean, dialectical synthesis, nonduality, or unity of opposites, in all matters.
	</p>
	<p>
		I always seek to understand both <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> to do whatever task I’m applying myself toward: both what could be useful for doing that task, and what doing that task could be useful for; as well as the human aspects of both the colleagues upon whom I depend in order to do my job, and the stakeholders who depend upon me to do it. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I love to learn, and I’m a very fast learner, drawing on my wide breadth of experience to gain fluency on new skills quickly, and strengthen those I already have. I also love to teach, to help others round out and polish up their skill sets.
	</p>
	<p>
		Academic and cognitive aptitude tests consistently score me around the top 1%. Personality tests rank me highly on conscientiousness and openness, just slightly more introverted than extroverted (I'm perfectly content by myself but have no problem in groups when I'm wanted there), and just slightly more agreeable than disagreeable (I love to make people happy but I'm not afraid to offer honest criticism when it's wanted from me).
	</p>
	<p>
		I thrive in a support role, helping others to achieve their goals; but I’m also comfortable in a leadership position, setting direction and architecting plans. My philosophy in this regard is to be simultaneously an advisor and assistant, suggesting what I think the best course of action would be for my clients or superiors, and then following through to the best of my ability on their decisions once they have been thus informed.
	</p>
	<p>
		I work extremely well independently, and have done so for most of my life; besides over a decade of remote work, most of my middle and high school years were done as independent study. But I also love it when my work can be part of a larger team effort, or when I can bring together the products of other people’s work.
	</p>
	<p>
		I can turn around tasks very quickly, and love to keep my to-do list clear and stay ready to jump on the next task immediately. But I also love any opportunity to spend much time working out every last detail of a complex project to perfection.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am looking for a steady career where the skills and experience I already have are enough as they are from day one, and where there are opportunities to learn and grow more in the future.
