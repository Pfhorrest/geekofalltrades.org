						Introduction
						<ul>
							<li>
								Guided journey through entire world of philosophy
							</li>
							<li>
								Novel system for professionals and recap of discourse for novices; something useful in either case
							</li>
							<li>
								Four core essays:
								<ul>
									<li>
										Metaphilosophical conclusions (why philosophy matters and what it is),
									</li>
									<li>
										Metaphilosophical analysis (from the outside in, from the inside out, and both forward and backward across time),
									</li>
									<li>
										Philosophical analysis (extremely moderate approach, between objectivism and subjectivism, rationalism and fideism),
									</li>
									<li>
										Philosophical conclusions (natural sciences are better than what we did before, and nurtural sciences would be better than what we do now).
									</li>
								</ul>
								Metaphilosophical analysis the greatest analytic novelty here,
								with nurtural sciences the biggest underdeveloped piece of that picture,
								and thus the most practical takeaway here.
							</li>
							<li>
								Then topic-by-topic breakdown from the meaning of life to the meaning of words
							</li>
							<li>
								Apology for audacity
							</li>

						The Basics

														Also intrinsic practice at being a person
														<br />
														"Martial arts for the mind and will"

													</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>
												Can philosophy get done at all?
												<ul>
													<li>
														Yes, it has: the physical sciences
														(separating education and the investigation of truth from religion,
														and connecting the learning of deep truths to the development of practical technologies)
														are both mostly logically mustered and mostly rhetorically disseminated
													</li>
													<li>
														And it still can more: the ethical sciences
														(separating governance and the accomplishment of good from state,
														and connecting the achievement of high goods to the development of practical businesses)
														are only haphazardly progressing in both their mustering and dissemination
													</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>
												What does it take to do philosophy?
												<ul>
													<li>
														Consciousness, curiosity, and bracketing (to do the logical mustering of philosophical solutions)
													</li>
													<li>
														Agency, courage, and serenity (to do the rhetorical dissemination of those solutions to an unreceptive world)
													</li>
												</ul>
												These are both the muscles needed to do it and those that will get grown by doing it.
												<br />
												(including current Introduction &gt; Overview &gt; maybe hopeless but trying anyway?)
											</li>
											<li>
												How is philosophy to be done?
												<ul>
													<li>
														Analytically and pragmatically
													</li>
													<li>
														Historically (where it's coming from) and dialectically (where that's all going)
													</li>
												</ul>
												(including current
												Introduction &gt; History, and
												Introduction &gt; Motivation &gt; "tried on")
											</li>
											<li>
												Who is to do philosophy?
												<ul>
													<li>
														Everyone (disseminating) and professionals (mustering)
													</li>
													<li>
														Generalists (disseminating) and specialists (mustering)
													</li>
												</ul>
												(including current Introduction &gt; Motivation &gt; dependencies, parallel solutions)
											</li>
											<li>
												What even is philosophy?
												<br />
												The investigation of broad and fundamental things
												<br />
												But demarcation problem
												<ul>
													<li>
														Not religion
													</li>
													<li>
														Not sophistry
													</li>
													<li>
														Not science
													</li>
													<li>
														Not politics
													</li>
													<li>
														Not math
													</li>
													<li>
														Not art
													</li>
												</ul>
												None of those, but rather the bridge from the abstract arts and mathematics,
												to the physical and ethical sciences; from abstract to concrete, and descriptive and prescriptive.
												About <em>useful</em> ways of </em>talking</em> about things,
												or rather avoiding counter-productive ways of talking about things,
												like either religion or sophistry; productive or useful toward
												the ability to tell superior answer from inferior ones,
												which is wisdom, which philosophy is the love or pursuit of.
												<br />
												(therefore... current Introduction &gt; Overview &gt; that common error + the general worldview + my phil is the view that ...)

												The Four Aspects (of "meaning?")
												<br />
												<br />
												Derivative of Aristotle's four "causes"
												<br />
												But not actually based directly on that;
												just two dichotomies found repeatedly all across philosophy.
												<ul>
													<li>
														Hylomorphism
														<br />
														<br />
														Potential-actual distinction
														<br />
														Ideal-material distinction
														<br />
														Noumenal-phenomenal distinction
														<br />
														Essential-existential distinction
														<br />
														Quiddity-haecceity distinction
														<br />
														Morphic-hylic distinction
														<br /><br />
														Basically stems all the way back to Thales, the first instance of supposing everything may be different forms of the same material.
														He said water; Anaximander said instead no particular known material, but some indefinite, or boundless, stuff.
														Pythagoras effectively said why bother with materials at all if there's no distinctions between them: it's all just forms.
														For my part I think Pythagoras more or less nailed it in three.
														<ul>
															<li>
																Potential
																<ul>
																	<li>
																		Form is external connection
																		<br />
																		(presages prescriptive)
																	</li>
																	<li>
																		Structure is internal connection
																		<br />
																		(presages descriptive)
																	</li>
																	<li>
																		Function is through-connection, external to internal to external, and synchronic identity
																		<br />
																		(presages indexical)
																	</li>
																</ul>
																Linguistic meaning as graphs of connections between forms or within structures
																<br />
																No distinction between invention and discovery yet
															</li>
															<li>
																Actual
																<ul>
																	<li>
																		Input to our functions as experience
																	</li>
																	<li>
																		Output from our functions as behavior
																	</li>
																	<li>
																		Reflexive internal function, self-experience and self-behavior, as diachronic identity
																	</li>
																</ul>
																Practical meaning as indexical connection through our own function
																<br />
																Distinction between invention and discovery arises
															</li>
														</ul>
														Form is the experience of function
														<br />
														Function is the behavior of structure
														<br />
														Structure is the reflexion of form
														<br />
														<br />
														We can take formless, functionless, structureless "atoms" (of, say, empty sets),
														and reflexively build structures out of them,
														which structures can behave in functional ways,
														the experiences of which functions are forms,
														which can be built into still further structures.
													</li>
													<li>
														Direction of fit
														<br />
														<br />
														Descriptive-prescriptive distinction
														<br />
														Is-ought distinction
														<br />
														Fact-norm distinction
														<br />
														<br />
														Plato's demiurge/phytourge, "artificial"/"natural", distinction.
														"It was made to do this" vs "it did this on its own".
														<ul>
															<li>
																Descriptive
																<ul>
																	<li>
																		Potential inputs restrict the actual
																		(the past restricts the present, us):
																		it <em>makes</em> us be this way
																	</li>
																	<li>
																		If our model and the world don't match,
																		our model is to be changed based on our experiences to match the world
																		(which does not preclude us also changing the world through our behaviors)
																	</li>
																	<li>
																		Doing so gives us the tools by which we in the present can direct the future
																		(the actual restricting potential outputs):
																		it is the source of our power, <em>how</em> we do anything
																	</li>
																</ul>
																The relationship across which potentials actualize things is <em>causation</em>.
																<br /><br />
																Reality is the cause of experiences, and behaviors are the cause of reality.
																<br /><br />
																Understanding the rules is what gives us the tools by which we obtain power.
															</li>
															<li>
																Prescriptive
																<ul>
																	<li>
																		The actual restricts potential inputs
																		(we, the present, restrict the past):
																		it <em>lets</em> us to be this way
																	</li>
																	<li>
																		If our model and the world don't match,
																		the world is to be changed through our behavior to match our model
																		(which does not preclude us also changing our model based on our experiences)
																	</li>
																	<li>
																		Doing so is the job toward which the future directs us in the present
																		(potential outputs restricting the actual):
																		it is the source of our responsibility, <em>why</em> we do anything
																	</li>
																</ul>
																The relationship across which things actualize their potentials is <em>purpose</em>
																<br /><br />
																Morality is the purpose of behaviors, and experiences are the purpose of morality.
																<br /><br />
																Accepting our responsibilities is what gets done the jobs through which we achieve our goals.
															</li>
														</ul>
														To have the power to achieve our goals, we must understand the rules and accept our responsibilities.
													</li>
												</ul>
												Before considering the intersection of description and prescription, this leaves us with four domains:
												<ul>
													<li>The potential descriptive: mathematics, where we pick a few arbitrary rules and see what we can derive from them</li>
													<li>The potential prescriptive: the arts, where we pick a few arbitrary goals and see what we can integrate into them</li>
													<li>The actual descriptive: the physical sciences, where we are given many things and see what we can derive them from</li>
													<li>The actual prescriptive: the ethical sciences, where we are given many things and see what we can integrate them into</li>
												</ul>
												But description and prescription can each be considered their own subsets, which then adds four more domains to this picture.
											</li>
											<li>
												The Eight Domains
												<br/>
												We can map the intersections of all three of these subsets of the ideas onto the surface of a sphere,
												ringing the borders of each around its equator and two orthogonal meridians, respectively.
												This gives us eight domains of consideration, each one an octant of the surface of the sphere.
												<ul>
													<li>
														One octant represents
														the domain of ideas considered with concern for their indexicality
														-- for how they actually matter in this particular functional chain --
														as well as both their descriptivity and prescriptivity,
														with how they are restricted by both their inputs and by their outputs.
														This is the domain of work, of all practical activities.
													</li>
													<li>
														Two sides of that octant border other octants that each respectively represent
														the domains of ideas still considered with
														concern for their indexicality, for whether they actually matter in any particular functional chain.
														but with concern for only one of their descriptivity or prescriptivity
														-- for whether they are restricted by their inputs, or instead by their outputs.
														These are the domains of the physical and ethical sciences.
													</li>
													<li>
														Those two octants in turn jointly border the fourth octant on that hemisphere,
														the domain of ideas considered with concern
														for their descriptivity and prescriptivity both
														-- for how they are restricted by both their inputs and by their outputs --
														but now without concern for their indexicality, for
														whether they actually matter in any particular functional chain.
														This is the domain of philosophy, considering both the true and the good, reality and morality,
														but in an abstract and general matter detached from any particular practical concerns.
													</li>
													<li>
														That in turn borders, along with one each of the two preceding octants of the physical and ethical sciences,
														the domains of ideas considered with similar concern for their descriptivity or prescriptivity separately
														-- for how they are restricted by their inputs, or by their outputs --
														but like philosophy, without concern for their indexicality, for whether they actually matter in any particular functional chain.
														These are the domains of math and the arts.
													</li>
													<li>
														And those in turn jointly border the octant exactly opposite the one we began with,
														the domain of ideas considered without concern for their
														descriptivity, prescriptivity, or indexicality: those that are neither
														restricted by their inputs, restricted by their outputs, nor restricted by
														whether they actually matter in any particular functional chain.
														This is the domain of pure language, for which we can invent any arbitrary rules,
														and which we can use toward any arbitrary goal, connecting to mathematics
														via logic's focus on applying syntactical rules of language,
														and to the arts via rhetoric's focus on attaining pragmatic goals of language.
													</li>
													<li>
														Altogether these form a ring of six octants
														-- from language, through descriptive and prescriptive topics, both abstract and practical, all the way around to work --
														surrounding the central octant of philosophy. But if that ring is thought of as the edge of a coin, with philosophy as one face of it,
														then the other face of that coin, exactly opposite philosophy, is the final octant,
														the domain of ideas considered with concern for their indexicality
														-- for how they actually matter in this particular functional chain --
														but without concern for their descriptivity or prescriptivity,
														for whether they are restricted by their inputs and by their outputs.
														This is the domain of concrete action in the actual world, but without limits
														either on how to do it or why to do it, where the goals and the rules are
														as made up as those of pure language: the domain of play, of games.
													</li>
												</ul>
												Every game is defined by its rules and its goals, as well as its players and its judges.
												The notions of rules and of goals correspond to the powers and responsibilities of the
												descriptive and prescriptive domains, exhibiting a nondual pattern
												that shows up throughout philosophy, such as in modality:
												rules concern what is impossible/impermissible or possible/permissible, setting out what tools players can (or can't) use;
												while goals concern what is necessary/obligatory or contingent/omissible, setting out what jobs they must (or don't have to) do.
												Many of the relations between different fields above can be framed therefore as parts of games:
												<ul>
													<li>
														Language is a game with its syntax as its tools and its pragmatics as its job;
														math is consequently the sub-game concerning the rules of language,
														and the arts are the sub-game concerning the goals of language.
													</li>
													<li>
														Work is a game with reality as it tools and morality as its job;
														the physical sciences are consequently the sub-game concerning the rules of work,
														and the ethical sciences are the sub-game concerning the goals of work.
													</li>
												</ul>
												Play, meanwhile, inherently produces what is effectively linguistic meaning,
												as 'moves' in whatever games we produce -- be they literal body movements, sounds we make,
												scratches in the dirt or on rocks or wood or paper, tokens of some kind we move about, whatever --
												take on significance, importance, meaning (semantics),
												from the rules we apply to them (a syntax) and the goals we pursue with them (a pragmatics).
												<br />
												<br />
												And also, as we are thrown into the world, we discover that in order to be free to do that kind of language-inventing play,
												there is a mandatory game we must play, the game of life, of work, where we are not told the rules or the goals
												but we will still fail and never get to play anything again if we don't figure them out and then attain those goals
												within the confines of those rules.
												<br />
												<br />
												That makes playing, in general, itself a kind of meta-game, where the goal is effectively to produce language, to create meaning,
												and the rule is you have to do the work to enable yourself to keep playing.
												<br />
												<br />
												Meanwhile, on the other side of the coin, the philosophy side, we can frame the whole philosophical endeavor as a similar kind of meta-game,
												the game whose goal is to enable work to be done, to serve the jobs of the physical and ethical sciences,
												and whose rule is to operate within the confines of language, to use the tools math and the arts, logic and rhetoric
												-- all of that ultimately using the tool of play, in its language-creating capacity, to do the job of play, inasmuch as it is enabled by work.
											</li>

												The Sixteen Topics
												<br />
												<br />
												If we thus delve deeper into the sub-games of philosophy, and the sub-games thereof, and so on deeper into the details,
												we should be able to find both all of jobs set out before philosophy, all of the questions it is supposed to answer,
												as well as all of the tools at its disposal, all of the means of answering such questions:
												<br />

												All of this hinges on time:
												<ul>
													<li>
														the potential is all eternal, timeless
													</li>
													<li>
														the actual is the temporal, seen from a particular time
													</li>
													<li>
														the descriptive is defined by the past restricting the future
													</li>
													<li>
														the prescriptive is defined by the future restricting the past
													</li>
												</ul>
												There are multiple ways to construe time in terms of informational entropy,
												partial orderings across the abstract space of forms/functions/structures,
												with the two extremes of those ways corresponding to descriptive and prescriptive orderings
												(a way things will go if they must, and a way things would go if they could)
												which can thus be framed in terms of rules and goals too
												(the overarching rule is max-entropy always increases,
												and the overarching goal is to increase min-entropy);
												and the spectrum of them orthogonal to each other presages the core principle of commensurablism.

										Arguments
										<ul>
											<li>
												Introduction &gt; Overview &gt; the general worldview...
											</li>
											<li>
												Pragmatism: trying, vs giving up
												<br />
												(adapted from current section "Pragmatic Justificiation")
											</li>
											<li>
												First synthesis: meliorism,
												vs narrow optimism, objectivism+fideism (dogmatic occultism)
												or narrow pessimism, rationalism+subjectivism (relativist skepticism)
												<br />
												(adapted from part of current section "The Opposition")
											</li>
											<li>
												Second synthesis: "commensurablism" qua critico-liberal universal phenomenalism
												(broad objectivism, broad subjectivism, broad rationalism, and broad fideism),
												vs "modernism" qua occult skepticism (narrow objectivism and narrow fideism),
												or "postmodernism" qua dogmatic relativism (narrow rationalism and narrow subjectivism)
												<br />
												(adapted from most of current essay and the other part of current section "The Opposition")
												<ul>
													<li>
														Narrow subjectivism (rejected for broad objectivism):<br />
														everything is mind-dependent
													= ~ some things are mind-independent
													</li>
													<li>
														Broad subjectivism (accepted over narrow objectivism):<br />
														everything is mind-accessible
													= ~ some things are mind-inaccessible
													</li>
													<li>
														Narrow rationalism (rejected for broad fideism):<br />
														reject things until reason compels their acceptance
													= ~ accept things before reason compels their acceptance
													</li>
													<li>
														Broad rationalism (accepted over narrow fideism):<br />
														accept things only until reason compels their rejection
													= ~ accept things even after reason compels their rejection
													</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>
												Here in the middle, mention the analogy of
												<br />
												objectivism : subjectivism : fideism : rationalism
												<br />
												::
												<br />
												objects : subjects : fiduciaries (institutions) : reasons (methods)
												<br />
												::
												<br />
												goals : players : judges : rules ;
												<br />
												times the four different 'games' to apply that to,
												the physical and ethical sciences as well as mathematics and the arts.
											</li>
											<li>
												Applying this to both descriptive and prescriptive questions,
												vs both scientism and <del>constructivism</del> <ins>politicism</ins> from current essay "On Cynicism", and parts of intro.
												<br />
												<br />
												Scientism is commensurablist about reality,
												but erroneously therefore incommensurablist about morality,
												supposedly because the good is not mind-independently existent,
												and existence-free objective reasoning seems incoherent
												<ul>
													<li>
														axial universalism seems ontologically occult
														<br />
														<br />
														(saying there is objective morality sounds like
														you're claiming something non-empirical, the good, is existent)
													</li>
													<li>
														and deontic criticism thus seems epistemically skeptical
														<br />
														<br />
														(saying some things are actually bad sounds like
														an epistemic limit, with no real basis, on thinking they're good)
													</li>
												</ul>
												So contrapositively:
												<ul>
													<li>
														axial relativism seems required by ontic phenomenalism
														<br />
														<br />
														(saying that morality is just things seeming good to you)
													</li>
													<li>
														and deontic dogmatism seems required by epistemic liberalism
														<br />
														<br />
														(saying that you're free to think that anything is good)
													</li>
												</ul>
												But the same distorted view also applies in reverse:
												politicism is commensurablist about morality,
												but erroneously therefore incommensurablist about reality, 
												supposedly because the truth is not will-independently valuable,
												and value-free objective reasoning seems incoherent
												<ul>
													<li>
														ontic universalism seems axiologically occult
														<br />
														<br />
														(saying there is objective reality sounds like
														you're claiming something non-hedonic, the truth, is valuable)
													</li>
													<li>
														and epistemic criticism thus seems deontically skeptical
														<br />
														<br />
														(saying some things are actually false sounds like
														a deontic limit, with no moral basis, on thinking they're true)
													</li>
												</ul>
												So contrapositively:
												<ul>
													<li>
														axial relativism seems required by ontic phenomenalism
														<br />
														<br />
														(saying that reality is just things seeming true to you)
													</li>
													<li>
														and epistemic dogmatism seems required by deontic liberalism
														<br />
														<br />
														(saying that you're free to think that anything is true)
													</li>
												</ul>
												Cover factual qua objective / normative qua reasoned-methodical X factual qua description / normative qua prescription here.
												<br />
												<br />
												Name alternate forms of each principle and anti-principle:
												<ul>
													<li>
														<ul>
															<li>
																ontic universalism or "realism" vs ontic relativism
															</li>
															<li>
																axial universalism or "moralism" vs axial relativism
															</li>
														</ul>

													</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>
												And applying to both indexical and non-indexical questions, vs "materialism" or "idealism", a la "third synthesis" notes:
												<br />
												<br />
												again,
												materialism is commensurablist about the material,
												but erroneously therefore incommensurablist about the ideal,
												supposedly because the ideal is not causal or purposeful,
												and non-causal existence and non-purposeful value seem incoherent
												<ul>
													<li>
														abstract universalism seems concretely occult
														<br />
														<br />
														(saying abstract entities are really existent sounds like
														you're claiming something non-empirical is existent)
													</li>
													<li>
														and analytic criticism thus seems synthetically skeptical
														<br />
														<br />
														(saying the meaning of words isn't a given sounds like
														you couldn't have any basis at all to claim anything is true)
													</li>
													<li>
														while attributive universalism seems predicatively occult
														<br />
														<br />
														(saying attributive ends are morally valuable sounds like
														you're claiming something non-hedonic is valuable)
													</li>
													<li>
														and procedural criticism thus seems distributively skeptical
														<br />
														<br />
														(saying the ownership of property isn't a given sounds like
														you couldn't have any basis at all to claim anything is good)
													</li>
												</ul>
												So contrapositively:
												<ul>
													<li>
														abstract relativism seems required by concrete phenomenalism
														<br />
														(saying that abstract entities are just made up in our minds)
													</li>
													<li>
														and analytic dogmatism seems required by synthetic liberalism
														<br />
														(saying that words just have to mean whatever it is that they do)
													</li>
													<li>
														while attributive relativism seems required by predicative phenomenalism
														<br />
														(saying that attributive ends are just made up in our wills)
													</li>
													<li>
														and attributive dogmatism seems required by predicative liberalism
														<br />
														(saying that property just has to belong to whoever it is that it does)
													</li>
												</ul>
												but the same distorted view also applies in reverse:
												idealism is commensurablist about the material,
												but erroneously therefore incommensurablist about the material,
												supposedly because the material is not eternal but always changing,
												and the real truth or moral good being ever-changing seems incoherent
												<ul>
													<li>
														concrete universalism seems abstractly occult
														<br />
														<br />
														(saying concrete entities are really existent sounds like
														saying something non-empirical is existent,
														like some property of "concreteness",
														or some "substance" in which forms inhere)
													</li>
													<li>
														and synthetic criticism thus seems analytically skeptical
														<br />
														<br />
														(saying synthetic truths cannot be known beyond question sounds like
														saying nothing actually means anything and anyone can just use any words however,
														since if we started with clearly-defined meanings then
														the truth would follow necessarily)
													</li>
													<li>
														while predicative universalism seems analytically occult
														<br />
														<br />
														(saying predicative ends are morally valuable sounds like
														saying something non-hedonic is valuable,
														like some property of "predicativeness",
														or some "wealth" that success obtains)
													</li>
													<li>
														and distributive criticism thus seems procedurally skeptical
														<br />
														<br />
														(saying distributive goods cannot be duties beyond question sounds like
														saying nobody actually owns anything and anyone can just use any property however,
														since if we started with clearly-defined ownership then
														the good would follow obligatorily)
													</li>
												</ul>
												So contrapositively:
												<ul>
													<li>
														concrete relativism seems required by abstract phenomenalism
														<br />
														(saying that what is concretely existent varies from person to person)
													</li>
													<li>
														and synthetic dogmatism seems required by analytic liberalism
														<br />
														(saying that synthetic truths can be known beyond question)
													</li>
													<li>
