	<h2>Philosophy Study Guide</h2>
	<p classs="description"></p>
	<p>
		This document is a study guide for philosophy as a whole. It will offer two different orders in which the subject can be studied, but in both of them it will proceed breadth-first, giving students a broad but shallow overview of the whole subject to begin with, and then a deeper focus on narrower parts of the subject afterward.
	</p>

	<p>
		The main sources of study to be used will be three online encyclopedias. They are, in decreasing order of quality:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu">The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a> ("SEP")
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://iep.utm.edu/">The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a> ("IEP")
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy">Wikipedia</a> ("WP")
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		These sources will generally give their own sources in turn, the primary texts written by these philosophers about these topics, where students can then continue their philosophical study in further depth.
	</p>

	<p>The two different orders for studying philosophy that this guide will offer are:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<b><a href="#historical">Historical order</a></b>, from ancient philosophy to modern philosophy, which is how most introductory classes on philosophy begin.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b><a href="#topical">Topical order</a></b>, from more theoretical philosophy to more applied philosophy, beginning with the logically prior technical topics like language, art, and mathematics, and building up from there to things like the relationship between science and religion, political philosophy, and the meaning of life.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Both the historical and topical structure are borrowed from my own philosophy book, <i><a href="../">The Codex Quarentis</a></i>, but other than the emphasis placed on those historical figures and those topics of study, my own philosophical opinions about them are omitted here in lieu of the scholarly consensus from these encyclopedias.</p>

		<p>Three very prominent philosophers serve as landmarks in the history of philosophy, through its traditional division into Ancient, Medieval, and Modern periods:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Socrates</b>
				(
					<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/socrates/">SEP</a>
				|
					<a href="https://iep.utm.edu/socrates/">IEP</a>
				|
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates">WP</a>
				)
				was the founding figure of the classical era of ancient philosophy.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Thomas Aquinas</b>
				(
					<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/">SEP</a>
				|
					<a href="https://iep.utm.edu/aquinas/">IEP</a>
				|
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas">WP</a>
				)
				was the founder of what became the dominant school of medieval philosophy.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Immanuel Kant</b>
				(
					<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/">SEP</a>
				|
					<a href="https://iep.utm.edu/kantview/">IEP</a>
				|
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant">WP</a>
				)
				was the latest figure crucial to both major branches of contemporary late modern philosophy.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			The history of philosophy has repeatedly seen the study of the subject split between two major competing schools of thought, and each of these landmark philosophers represents a punctuation of such division: a unification of the preceding two schools of thought, and the common ground from which the following two schools of thought diverge.
		</p>
		<p>
			A deeper level study can thus begin with the philosophers with whom those preceding schools of thought culminated, and those who initiated the following schools of thought after each of these landmark philosophers.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Thales</b>
				(
					<a href="https://iep.utm.edu/thales/">IEP</a>

			The subtopics within philosophy can be arranged in relation to each other along a number of different axes, and two of the most important axes are the descriptive-to-prescriptive axis, and the theoretical-to-applied axis. These may seem superficially alike but they can be reckoned separately, orthogonally to each other. The descriptive topics have to do with things like existence, mind, knowledge, and education; while the prescriptive topics have to do with things like value, will, justice, and governance. Meanwhile, the theoretical topics have to do with things like the language with which we make claims about such things, either descriptive or prescriptive, and when and how such claims could be reckoned correct; while the applied topics have to do with how both those descriptive and prescriptive matters factor into how to live our lives in practice.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Philosophy of language</b>
				(
					<a href="https://iep.utm.edu/lang-phi/">IEP</a>
				|
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_language">WP</a>
				)
				is perhaps the most theoretical topic within philosophy, being entirely about the meaning of words, in contrast to the meaning of life.
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				<b>Metaphysics</b>
				(
					<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/metaphysics/">SEP</a>
				|
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics">WP</a>
				)
				is the broad and general descriptive topic, the philosophical inquiry into what is real.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Ethics</b>
				(
					<a href="https://iep.utm.edu/ethics/">IEP</a>
				|
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics">WP</a>
				)
				is the broad and general prescriptive topic, the philosophical inquiry into what is moral.
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				<b>The meaning of life</b>
				(
					<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/life-meaning/">SEP</a>
				|
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_of_life">WP</a>
				)
				is the big applied topic that draws many people into philosophy to begin with, into which many if not all of the other philosophical topics factor.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Near each of the poles of the theoretical-applied axis are other closely-related fields separated along the descriptive-prescriptive axis; and on each side of that descriptive-prescriptive axis proper, there are multiple fields separated not only along the theoretical-applied axis, but also along a third axis from <em>what</em> is real, moral, knowable, or just, to <em>who</em> are the subjects and institutions of reality, morality, knowledge, and justice.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this section of this study guide, we will proceed from the theoretical to the applied, on both the descriptive and prescriptive sides of things, and addressing both the <em>what</em> and the <em>who</em> questions as we go.

					|
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_philosophy">WP</a>

				is a topic closely related to meaningfulness in life, but focusing more on the descriptive side, about inspiring the mind to actively pursue the truth, the real, the knowable, and so to become fully fully conscious or self-aware.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Empowerment</b>
				(
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empowerment">WP</a>
				)
				is a topic closely related to meaningfulness in life, but focusing more on the prescriptive side, about inspiring the will to actively pursue the good, the moral, or the just, and so to become fully free or self-directed.
